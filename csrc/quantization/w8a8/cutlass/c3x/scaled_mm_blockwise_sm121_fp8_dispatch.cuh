/**
 * Blockwise scaled GEMM for SM121 (GB10)
 *
 * NOTE: Blockwise quantization for SM_121 is currently not implemented.
 * The SM100/SM120 blockwise implementations use architecture-specific
 * ScaleConfig features that require significant additional work to adapt.
 *
 * For now, blockwise calls will throw an error directing users to use
 * per-tensor quantization instead.
